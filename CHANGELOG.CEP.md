# CEP Changelog

This changelog follows the format defined here (beginning with v4.0): https://keepachangelog.com/en/1.0.0/

##v1.0 - Initial release

##v1.1 - (19 July 2018)
* Directory structure has been reorganized (details below)
* Upgraded to the non-deprecated mor1kx (added as a subnodule)
* Verified with both the pre-built and build-your-own version of the Newlib toolchain as described on [http://openrisc.io](http://openrisc.io)
* In addition to test vectors for each of the cores, some additional test_software, such as "hello world", have been added for reference
* Expanded testbench (details below)
* Bug fixes and general code cleanup [Additional details in the git commit history]

##v1.1.1 - (27 September 2018)
* Added CEP\_utilization\_placed.rpt in implSummaries directory.  This summarizes utlization of the CEP v1.1 targetted to the VC707 using Vivado 2018.1.

##v1.2 - (15 November 2018)
* Major Update: The underlying bus has been converted from Wishbone-B4 to AXI4-Lite.  All cores as well as the MOR1KX has been wrapped with translation modules.  All the wrapping logic and interconnect are now in SystemVerilog.
* Regression Suite: In additon to each core's unit tests, a regression test suite has been included.  When compiled by the or1k toolchain, it be loaded/synthesized into the CEP RAM block and run at boot time.
* Modelsim Testing: Unit-level and system-level modelsim-based testbenches added
* GPS clkgen: The GPS clock gen component has been moved to the top level of the CEP, simplifying its replacement when targetting an ASIC.
* Misc. bug fixes

##v2.0 - (16 August 2019)
* Major Update: mor1k proceesor core replaced with the UCB Rocket-Chip within the SiFive Freedom U500 Platform.  All modules have been updated to support TileLink natively.  Currently only the AES and FIR cores have been integrated, but v2.1 will include the re-release of all the CEP cores.   

##v2.1 - (31 October 2019)
* Integrated DES3, GPS, MD5, RSA, SHA256, DFT, IDFT, and IIR cores.

##v2.2 - (31 January 2020)
* Added co-simulation environment that supports both Bus Functional Model (BFM) and Baremetal simulation modes.  Additional diagnostic capabilities within Linux.

##v2.3 - (17 April 2020)
* Added unit-level testbenches for all CEP cores.  Co-simulation modified to generate unit-level test stimulus.  

##v2.4 - (5 June 2020)
* CEP core test coverage expanded
* Unit testbenches transactional-level support added
* AES-derived and FIR-derived generated cores added
* Misc. bug fixes

##v2.5 - (31 July 2020)
* All Unit-level testbenches have been expanded to optional support the Logic Locking Keying Interface (LLKI)
  for both cycle-level and transactional-level modes

##v2.51 - (7 August 2020)
* Legacy unused core wrapper files (axi4lite and wb) removed

##v2.52 - (2 September 2020)

* riscv-tools (formerly under rocket-chip) now located in ./software/riscv-gnu-toolchain
* KNOWN ISSUES:
    - The iCacheCoherency passes when running bare-metal simulation, but fails when running on the VC-707.  There is an issue with
      the iCache protocol that the tight-looped iCache coherency test results in one or more of the Rocket Cores (there are 4 in 
      the CEP) L1 iCache not getting the value associated with the most recent write to instruction memory.

      Functionally, this should only cause an issue when dealing with self-modifying code, which is an atypical coding practice.

##v2.61 - (2 October 2020)
  - Added initial simulation support for Cadence XCellium
  - Cosim: Expanded DDR3 memory size to support "larger" bare-metal executables created by the new RISCV toolchain released with v2.6

##v2.7 - (28 October 2020)
* Added support for RISC-V ISA tests (under ./cosim/isaTests)
* Updated license statements to BSD-2-Clause
* KNOWN ISSUES:
  - The iCacheCoherency passes when running bare-metal simulation, but fails when running on the VC-707.  There is an issue with
    the iCache protocol that the tight-looped iCache coherency test results in one or more of the Rocket Cores (there are 4 in 
    the CEP) L1 iCache not getting the value associated with the most recent write to instruction memory.

    Functionally, this should only cause an issue when dealing with self-modifying code, which is an atypical coding practice.

  - The following cosim tests fail when run under RHEL using the "new" RISC-V toolchain:
    - bareMetalTests/cacheCoherence
    - isaTests/rv64mi-p-access 
    - isaTests/rv64ud-p-ldst

##v2.71 - (2 November 2020)
* Corrected README.md issue

##v3.0 - (18 December 2020)

##v3.1 - (22 February 2021) 
* Full LLKI support (All CEP cores are now LLKI enabled)
* Known Issues:
  - cep_diag (on Linux) has NOT been updated to work with the LLKI.  Thus, running the tests that use
    the CEP cores (e.g., cep_aes, cep_des3, etc.) will result in failure
  - rv64si-p-dirty ISA test fails
  - unit_simulations need to be updated to be compatible with the LLKI

##v3.11 - (29 March 2021)
* Unit Simulations updated for full LLKI support
* GPS core bugfix to provide specification compliance and increase functional coverage
* SRoT tests added
* SRoT has been updated to use a single port (1RW) RAM.
* Misc. bug fixes and README cleanup
* Known Issues:
  - cep_diag (on Linux) has NOT been updated to work with the LLKI.  Thus, running the tests that use
    the CEP cores (e.g., cep_aes, cep_des3, etc.) will result in failure

##v3.2 - (16 April 2021)
* LLKI bug fixes 
* Scratchpad RAM added
* Cadenece xcelium simulator and coverage support added
* Linux tests updated and expanded
* New tests added to cosim focused on LLKI and Scratchpad RAM

##v3.3 - (19 May 2021)
* Increased capacity for LLKI key size including larger KeyRAM (2048 64-bit words)
* Added Cosim JTAG/OpenOCD 
* Stability fixes for cep_diag under Linux 
* Virtual Address TLB test suite is added to regression (not 100% complete)
* Expanded cep_diag
* New simulation ONLY interrupt tests for CLINT and PLIC modules (on going)
* Re-capture vectors for unit sim due to changes in LLKI key size
* Bootrom size is increased to 32K bytes (8kx32) to accomodate new built-in test (execute codes out of bootrom without main memory)
