## What is Chipyard

Chipyard is an open source framework for agile development of Chisel-based systems-on-chip.
It will allow you to leverage the Chisel HDL, Rocket Chip SoC generator, and other [Berkeley][berkeley] projects to produce a [RISC-V][riscv] SoC with everything from MMIO-mapped peripherals to custom accelerators.
Chipyard contains processor cores ([Rocket][rocket-chip], [BOOM][boom], [CVA6 (Ariane)][cva6]), accelerators ([Hwacha][hwacha], [Gemmini][gemmini], [NVDLA][nvdla]), memory systems, and additional peripherals and tooling to help create a full featured SoC.
Chipyard supports multiple concurrent flows of agile hardware development, including software RTL simulation, FPGA-accelerated simulation ([FireSim][firesim]), automated VLSI flows ([Hammer][hammer]), and software workload generation for bare-metal and Linux-based systems ([FireMarshal][firemarshal]).
Chipyard is actively developed in the [Berkeley Architecture Research Group][ucb-bar] in the [Electrical Engineering and Computer Sciences Department][eecs] at the [University of California, Berkeley][berkeley].
