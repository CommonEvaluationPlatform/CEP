# GPS code generator
Generates three codes used for GPS signal correlation (from the perspective of a space vehicle): C/A-code, P-code, and a secure form of P-code that we call L-code.  The combination of the P-code generator and the L-code is meant to serve as a surrogate for the M-code generator found in modern secure GPS systems.  The goal of this core is to provide reference implementations for items that a GPS designer would like to protect from an untrusted manufacturer; it is not a fully-functional GPS unit.

## Functionality:
While this block generates accurate P-code and C/A-code sequences, it does not implement the GPS spec exactly. Notable differences:
* "L-code" is a proxy for the M-code, and in this implementation just encrypts with AES in 128 bit blocks.
  * Note that the default AES key is currently 0x00000... This can be customized as needed in gps.scala
* Generates batches of 128 bits of the P-code and 13 bits of C/A-code, which roughly approximates the 10:1 ratio of a real GPS device. Likewise real GPS systems have precise timing specifications which are not followed here.
