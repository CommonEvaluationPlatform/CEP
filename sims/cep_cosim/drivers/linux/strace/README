# This directory is the latest strace for RISCV. 5.11

The released version 4.11 under software/freedom-u-sdk/buildroot/package/strace is old and NOT supported. And it is no longer reside where it is supposed to be.

To enable the build, remove the old directory and replace with this new one and add a line to :

software/freedom-u-sdk/conf/buildroot_initramfs_config

as such : BR2_PACKAGE_STRACE=y
