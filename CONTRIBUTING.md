Contributing to Chipyard
=============================

### Branch management:

1) github:com/ucb-bar/chipyard: main = pre-release non-stable branch with latest features. All merges to main must go through PR.
2) github:com/ucb-bar/chipyard: specific tag / tagged branch = official chipyard release.
3) Other dependencies pointed at by Chipyard (e.g. firesim, boom): master/main should be the version submoduled in ucb-bar/chipyard main.
